# PracticalMachineLearning
One thing that people regularly these days is quantify how much of a particular activity they 
do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, my goal will be to 
use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. 
They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
